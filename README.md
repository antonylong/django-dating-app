## To Do

- build the backend
- build the frontend
- add extra features

## Problems

- Antony had an issue with JWT, which took a long time. Was having an error "JWT: 'module' object has no attribute 'encode'". This took quite a while to resolve. Required for virtual environments on local machine to be deleted and reinstall the project.

## Sources

This was inspired by our love of anime.
